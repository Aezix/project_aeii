UNIT_DESCRIPTION_0=Soldiers are all-round solid fighters, and they can capture or repair villages to give you benefits.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_1=With their powerful bows archers can attack from a distance and are especially efficient against airborne enemies.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_2=Elements are friends of the water. When in water, they become much more stronger.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_3=They are skilled in the use of necromancy. Sorceresses are weak in melee combat but they can summon skeletons from the dead to aid you in the battle.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_4=These mystical beings of pure light have an aura that can remove negative effects from your allies and heal them a little bit.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_5=Wolves are fearsome hunters with very high motility. They travel very fast on land and kill enemies with their poisonous bites.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_6=Golems are ancient beings, incredibly strong in physical defence and are even stronger when in the mountains.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_7=Catapults blaze a trail of destruction with their enormous attack range. However they have very low motility.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_8=These massive flying beasts have ruled the sky since ancient times. They have very high motility and deadly melee attacks.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_9=Commander is the heart of an army. He has quite strong battle skills and can capture enemy castles.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_10=Skeletons are undead beings summoned by necromancers. They are not very strong but have poisonous attacks.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_11=<none>
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_12=Paladins are holy armies who are skilled at healing and can also capture villages like soldiers do.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_13=Berserkers are born fighters. The more enemies are around them the stronger they become.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_14=<none>
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_15=Black mages are skilled at using dark magic. Their attacks are always powerful against those with low magic defence.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_16=<none>

UNIT_GUIDE_0=Soldiers are very useful in the early game, they can capture or repair villages to give you advantage. Although soldiers are not very powerful fighters, they can deal some decent damages to enemies with low physical defence.
UNIT_GUIDE_1=Archers start with quite low attack power, but due to their long attack range you can level them up more easily then soldiers. As they level up their attack will be more powerful. Meanwhile archers are also good at destroying air forces.
UNIT_GUIDE_2=Elements can move and fight much more efficiently in the water, so if you are planning to pick up a fight in places covered by water element is a good choice.
UNIT_GUIDE_3=Sorceresses can summon skeletons from fallen units, so if the battle goes intense and many units die it's a good idea to recruit sorceresses. But since sorceresses are weak against physical melee attacks you should move them smartly.
UNIT_GUIDE_4=The refresh aura of spirits can remove debuff from as well as heal allies around them which means spirits are really good against wolves and skeletons. Note that spirits can fight better in forest but are weak against archers.
UNIT_GUIDE_5=Wolves have deadly physical attacks and can move swiftly on land, so you can use them to destroy enemy key units quickly. But since wolves cannot receive terrain heal you should consider recruiting some healers.
UNIT_GUIDE_6=Golems have very high physical defence and become even tougher when in mountains so they are good at defending enemies' physical attacks. However golems have relatively low magic defence so keep them away from enemy magic users.
UNIT_GUIDE_7=Catapults have the longest attack range of all units so you can use them to destroy enemy back lines. Also you can use catapults to destroy villages. But since catapults have little defence against melee attacks and cannot attack once moved so you have to protect them properly.
UNIT_GUIDE_8=Dragons are powerful air forces, they can move through all terrains easily and destroy enemies with their deadly attacks. Note that dragons' melee attacks can be even more deadly so make sure to put that in good use.
UNIT_GUIDE_9=Commanders can capture enemy castles which is the key to victory. But since you cannot do that at the beginning and commander's recruiting price increases every time they die, you will want to protect him and level him up as much as you can.
UNIT_GUIDE_10=Skeletons have very low attack power which means they are not good at dealing instant damages. But it's always a good idea trying to use skeletons to apply poison status to enemy key units.
UNIT_GUIDE_11=-
UNIT_GUIDE_12=Note that paladins' heal can exceed allies' max HP cap so you can use them to increase the attack power of your allies. Also paladins' heal can become holy damage to skeletons so you can use them to kill skeletons and avoid being poisoned.
UNIT_GUIDE_13=Since the more enemies are around the more attack power and physical defence berserkers gain, so when you are outnumbered try to recruit some berserkers. Also berserkers' attack aura can make your allies stronger and avoid negative affects.
UNIT_GUIDE_14=-
UNIT_GUIDE_15=Black mages have no abilities but they have quite high magic attack which makes them good magic damage dealers. However black mages are not that good at melee combat so try to use them wisely.
